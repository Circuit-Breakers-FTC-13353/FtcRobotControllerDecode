# The SOP Process Rule
This document defines the team's official process for software tool documentation.

---

### The Rule

**A tool is not considered "done" until its Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is written, reviewed, and saved to the `/docs` folder.**

---

### Responsibilities

1.  **The Author:** The programmer who writes the code for a tool is responsible for writing the first draft of its SOP using the official template.

2.  **The Reviewer:** Before the tool is approved, another team member (preferably a non-programmer, like a builder or driver) must read the SOP and attempt to use the tool. Their feedback is used to refine the document for maximum clarity.

3.  **The Location:** The final SOP document must be saved in the `/docs/SOPs/` directory of the team's code repository.
